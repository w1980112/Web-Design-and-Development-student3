    <h1>Page Editor Portfolio</h1>
    <p><b>Name: </b>ROGGER SANCHEZ</p>
    <p><b>Role: </b>Student 3</p>
    <p><b>The following pages were edited by me: </b></p>
<div>
    <p><a href="profile.html">Profile.html</a></p>
    <p><a href="Team.html">Team.html</a></p>
    <p><a href="content_ST3.html">Content_ST3.html</a></p>


    <h2><b>Structure</b></h2>
    <p><B>User Profile Form: </B></p>
    <P>User Profile Form: This code implements an interactive form divided into steps to collect user information such as personal details, address, skills and education. Uses div elements to organize sections and controls navigation between them using JavaScript</P>
    <p><b>Equipment Section:</b></p>
    <p>Introduce members of an executive team with photos and brief descriptions of their roles. Focuses on visual presentation using div for each member and img for photos, applying styles to create a cohesive and attractive look</p>
    <p><b>Education Page:</b></p>
    <p>Offers content on the importance of education, with sections dedicated to methodologies, inspiring stories, and study resources Uses a clear semantic structure with div for sections and navigation links that lead to different parts of the content</p>
    
    <h2>Styles</h2>
    <p><b>User Profile Form: </b></p>
    <p>Apply an image background with CSS and use visual progression to guide the user through the steps of the form Styles focus on readability and user experience</p>
    <p><b>Equipment Section:</b></p>
    <p>Uses CSS animations to emphasize images of team members on hover, creating dynamic interaction The design is clean and modern, with a strong focus on visual presentation</p>
    <p><b>Education Page: </b></p>
    <p>Employs a consistent and contrasting color scheme for easy reading Navigation and sections are clearly defined, with a style that promotes accessibility and ease of use</p>
    
    <h2>Interactive Functionality</h2>
    <p><b>User Profile Form: </b></p>
    <p>Incorporates JavaScript to manage navigation between the different steps of the form, update the progress bar and collect data for final reviewÂ· This interactivity improves the user experience when completing the form.</p>
    <p><b>Equipment Section:</b></p>
    <p>Through CSS, an animation is implemented that responds to hovering over the images, adding an interactive element that draws attention to team members.</p>
    <p><b>Education Page: </b></p>
    <p>Although this code does not include JavaScript for complex interactive functionality, it uses internal links in the navigation bar to facilitate access to the different content sections, improving user navigation.</p>


    <h2>General considerations</h2>
    <p><b>Accessibility: </b></p>
    <p>All three codes show a concern for accessibility, with contrasting color schemes and clear structures that help users navigate content easily.</p>
    <p><b>Responsive Design:</b></p>
    <p>Although the approach varies, they all incorporate responsive design elements, such as viewport metadata on the education page, ensuring the pages work well on mobile and desktop devices.</p>
    <p><b>Responsive Design: </b></p>
    <p>Each code uses different techniques to engage the user, from interactive forms and animations to intuitive navigation, highlighting the importance of a positive user experience.</p>
   
    <h2>Main Project</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, all three codes represent web applications with different goals but share modern web design principles, such as attention to user experience, accessibility and responsive design. Each uses HTML, CSS and, in some cases, JavaScript, to create effective and attractive user interfaces tailored to their respective purposes</p>
