<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p>Everyone should have the opportunity to learn and grow. This is very important to make the world a better place. The 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) came up with a plan to help people learn better. The plan said that everyone should go to school by 2015. The plan also said that boys and girls should have the same opportunities to go to school by 2005 and 2015. The JPOI wanted to teach people to take care of the environment atmosphere at school and other places, such as clubs and workshops.</p>

<h2><b>Methodologies</b></h2>
<p><b>Online Education and Use of Technologies</b></p>
<P> The digitization of education through online platforms and open educational resources promises to overcome geographical and economic barriers. Adaptive technology, for its part, personalizes learning according to individual needs, thus facilitating a more inclusive education.</P>
  
<p><b> Promotion of Inclusive Education</b></p>

<p>The adaptation of curricula and the implementation of universally designed teaching methods seek to address the diversity of students. It is essential to ensure accessible physical environments in educational institutions to include students with disabilities.</p>
<p><b>Financial and Psychosocial Support</b></p>

<p>Scholarships targeting underserved populations and mentoring and psychosocial support programs are crucial to removing economic and social barriers that prevent access to education.</p>

<h2>Study methods</h2>
<p><b>1. Gamification</b></p>
  <P>Games are a way to allow students to demonstrate their various skills and gain confidence with their application in learning.</P>
  
<p><b>2. Simulation of situations</b></p>
  <p>Giving students roles or using virtual simulation to put themselves in the shoes of other people can help them generate greater respect, tolerance and empathy with their environment.</p>
  
<p><b>3. Teamwork</b></p>
  <p>Betting on diverse and multidisciplinary teams that need the support of their colleagues to fill gaps and reinforce skills.</p>
  
<p><b>4. Case method</b></p>
  <p>Proposing real problems or cases in which teams must understand what is happening and look for solutions, through their initiative and creative spirit.</p>
  
<p><b>5. Generation of experiences</b></p>
<p>Living with the community, getting to know your surroundings and leaving your comfort zone will allow everyone to experience something new. Whether it is the possibility of finding your vocation and setting goals, or being aware of the social impact that your future professional and personal development can have.</p>
